<b>Summary</b>

This is my rock, paper, and scissors game primarily written in Javascript.  The user can choose rock, paper, or scissors and the computer will select its choice.  There is also a function to keep track of the player's scores.

Initially, I had coded a version of this game using mostly html but decided to implement more javascript to further my understanding of using it with the DOM.  Conceptually, I've gained a lot of in my understanding of the DOM and look forward to progressing my skills.
